&lt;h2&gt;Rapid Recruiting for Iterative Studies&lt;/h2&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Me</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:,2016-11-01:rapid-recruiting-for-iterative-studies.html</guid></item><item><title>ARE THE FEATURES WE SHIP ACTUALLY BEING USED?</title><link>/are-the-features-we-ship-actually-being-used.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;TEST&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a question every product team should constantly ask themselves. Feature useage can be thought of as a signal for demand for that feature. Therefore, knowing feature useage can help product teams prioritize the next round of iterations on those set of features that are in high demand. As the user researcher with Wrap Media, I recently measured and visualized feature useage from a REST API using R. The outcome was feature useage dashboard leading to a data-driven approach to prioritizing product sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
